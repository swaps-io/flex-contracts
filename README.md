## Description

### Overview

_"Flex" protocol_ is the superior successor to the "Flash Trade" protocol.

During the operation of the previous version of the protocol, the development team has found several issues that limit
further protocol improvement, and therefore make it difficult to keep enhancing the end user experience. The problems
and solutions to them are described in detail in the [section below](#rationale).

In short, the new Flex protocol allows to conduct order-based deals between parties in a more _flexible_ way, addressing
the issues of the previous version. The flexibility primarily comes from new _dynamic_ [order](#order) structure, that's
made out of Flex [components](#component). The components can be selected, configured, and put together in
[various ways](#flow) according to the current needs of the participating parties. Once an order is created, it's
executed on-chain by an agreed party - for each component there is a designated Flex [facet](#facet) designed to work
with it.

### Rationale

The main source of the previous Flash Trade protocol issues was the _monolithic_ order structure. The old structure
consisted of _all_ order fields that are required for the protocol flow. This meant an _entire_ order must be presented
for _every_ operation is in the flow, since order is uniquely identified by the hash of _all_ of its fields. The
implications of this are:

- Modifying order structure in any way (for example, by adding or removing fields) makes _all_ deployed facets that work
  with it invalid, requiring contract re-deploy across multiple chains to fix it.
- Most of the data passed to a facet is _not necessary_ for the functionality itself, but only used to compute the hash.
  This means transaction cost increase for _all_ flow operations if we keep adding new fields in order to implement a
  new functionality and pass them as calldata.
- While it's possible to support multiple order types to address previous issues (for example, order with some extra
  data and one without it), this approach creates its own complications. Now every order type requires its own copy of
  every existing facet, _duplicating_ most of the original code. This makes maintaining and scaling difficult,
  especially across multiple chains.

As can be seen, the monolithic order structure issues make it difficult to implement and support new functionality,
including support for new flows that require their distinct set of fields, or adding support for new chains, that
operate different address types (non-EVM) etc.

The new Flex [order](#order) structure overcomes these issues by grouping functionality into _logical_ components.
Each component is designed to be only aware of data it actually needs. This isolates a component facet from the rest
of unrelated facets, allowing to introduce new components without unnecessary code duplication or re-deployment of
existing facets.

In most cases, an interaction with a component facet only requires the [component data](#component-data) and the
[order branch](#order-tree) to the [order hash](#order-hash), plus some extra dynamic data if intended by the
facet implementation. An example of such dynamic data can be [order signature](#order-signature) from one of the
order parties to authorize an operation, or [proof verifier](#proof-verifier) data for confirming an operation
success.

### Order

Flex order is composed out of multiple [components](#component). The selected set of components specifies
possible [flows](#flow) for the order. The order composure [examples](#examples) can be found in sections below.

The components form the [order tree](#order-tree). The tree can be then hashed, producing the [order hash](#order-hash),
that can be used as a unique identifier of the order. Order hash is also essential for producing the
[order signature](#order-signature).

#### Order Tree

Flex order is represented by the [Merle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) data structure. The "data
blocks" of the tree correspond to the [component data](#component-data), that is then [hashed](#component-hash) to
get the "leaves" of the tree. Leaves can be further [hashed](#order-hash) together to get the "root" hash, that
serves as unique identifier of entire Flex order content.

The main property of the Merkle tree data structure is that only _tree branch_ is needed to compute the root hash. This
property is used in Flex component facet implementations, when specific component data and the order branch are passed
in calldata, so the order hash can be computed on-chain with no need to present other components.

> ![Facet C Call Example](./data/images/facet-c-call.svg)

Some Flex components may depend on data of other components (or even on data referenced by multiple components).
To avoid passing extra order branches for multiple components, the dependant data can be nested by the component using
a hash value field. Usually this means both the component and dependant data should be passed in calldata along with
single order branch, so the order hash can be computed.

Flex SDK provides the following functions for interacting with the order tree structure:

- `flexCalcTree({ leaves })` - builds Flex order tree containing all specified `leaves` (i.e.
  [component hashes](#component-hash))
- `flexCalcBranch({ tree, leaf })` - builds `tree` branch from the `leaf` to the root hash

The SDK implementation puts all leaves on _one_ level which results in the same (Â±1) branch length for each of them.
It also applies _sorting_ to the leaves in order to be ready for _multi-branches_ (see OpenZeppelin's multi proofs).
Currently the multi-branches are _never_ used in the facet implementations - all cases are covered using dependency
components as shown above. If supporting multi-branches is not a concern - the tree can be constructed even _manually_,
putting leaves on different levels for fine-tuning branch lengths (for example, according to chain cost expectations).

#### Order Hash

Flex order hash is a 32-byte value equal to the [order tree](#order) root hash. Flex protocol uses `keccak256` as the
hash function for producing order tree leaves and intermediate tree node hashes. See the section above for the visual
representation.

Each of the tree _nodes_ is represented by 2 _word_ (32-byte each) data. Each word is the `keccak256` hash of a leaf or
hash of a node on the lower level. The node words are _sorted_ in the ascending order, so the `keccak256` hash produced
from the node data is _commutative_. This property means that the hash value remains the same regardless of the order of
the arguments.

Note that while the tree branch hashes are used in commutative hash and thus don't require extra info about their
placement as hash parameter, the branch should be encoded to have the _first_ element to be neighboring hash closest
to the tree _leaf_, and the last element to be neighboring to hash closest to the _root_ hash (but _not_ including the
root).

Order hash can be computed using SDK functions:

- `flexCalcTreeHash({ tree })` - returns the root hash of the `tree`
- `flexCalcBranchHash({ leaf, branch })` - calculates the root hash from `leaf` and its `branch` in the tree

#### Order Signature

Order signature by one of the [flow](#flow) parties may be needed for a component as an operation authorization step.
The signing party can be an Externally Owned Account (EOA) or a smart contract. In both cases the signed value is the
[order hash](#order-hash) or derived from it.

The _EOA signature_ is produced by the private key of the owner. The 32-byte order hash value can be signed with the
_Ethereum message_ wrap according to the [EIP-191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191) standard or even signed
_directly_ (non-default, requires _flag_ - see info below). The recovered signer must match the expected address from
the [data](#component-data) of verifying component.

> [!TIP]
>
> The EIP-191 signature can be obtained with:
>
> - [MetaMask](https://metamask.io)'s
>   [`personal_sign`](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/reference/json-rpc-methods/personal_sign)
> - [`viem`](https://viem.sh)'s [`signMessage`](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/wallet/signMessage)
> - [`ethers`](https://ethers.org)'s [`signMessage`](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/#Signer-signMessage)

> [!NOTE]
>
> The EIP-191 standard _should not_ be confused with [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712). Providing the
> typed data signature (for example, by using `eth_signTypedData_v4` instead of `personal_sign`) will result in signer
> recovery failure.
>
> While EIP-712 standard is better than EIP-191 in terms of _observability_ of the structure being signed and _domain_
> verification functionality, it's very limited in _dynamic_ and _tightly packed_ data support the protocol needs.
> These issues are addressed with:
>
> - _thorough_ off-wallet verification of the Flex order structure component fields by both automated code logic & UI
>   user, ensuring the calculated hash fully matches the hash displayed in wallet UI during signing.
> - _custom per-component_ [_domain_](#component-domain) mechanism along with contract deployment rules for ensuring
>   signature cannot be re-used in unexpected components.

The _contract signature_ variant allows verification logic to be implemented by a smart contract. The verifying contract
address comes from the [component data](#component-data). For successful flow, the contract must support
[EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) standard, i.e. provide `isValidSignature` function that returns the
signature check result. The `hash` parameter passed to the function is the Flex order hash, the `signature` value is
forwarded as-is from the facet calldata.

The [`FlexSignatureConstraint`](./contracts/libraries/constraints/FlexSignatureConstraint.sol) library provides logic
for validating all of the supported signature types. Besides the order hash and signature bytes, the library accepts
pack of 3 [flags](#flags) that can be passed from the component data (i.e. configured during order formation and cannot
be modified) to control the signature checks:

- Contract signature flag (_#0_) - should the library _skip_ EOA signature check attempt and go straight to the contract
  signature verification. Otherwise attempts to recover EOA signature first, and if it fails - does the contract
  signature verification attempt (if allowed by flag _#2_). This flag is preferred to be set when it's known that
  the contract signature verification flow should be used to save gas costs by skipping the EOA attempt.
- No message signature wrap flag (_#1_) - should the library _skip_ the default wrap of order hash into the EIP-191
  message. The flag should only be enabled when the original order hash was _directly_ signed with private key.
- No retry as contract signature flag (_#2_) - should library _skip_ attempt to verify signature as the contract one
  after EOA recovery failure. Enabling this flag asserts that the signature is expected _only_ as an EOA signature.
  This flag is preferred to set when it's _know_ that EOA signature is provided for ensuring no extra logic run.

>
> It's recommended to establish signing party capabilities beforehand and _setup the signature flags accordingly_

#### Flags

Flex flags are booleans encoded using single bit per value. Flags can be _packed_ - i.e. grouped together for easier
access. Flag with index 0 occupies _least significant bit_, index 1 - next bit by significance after the previous value,
and so on.

Usually flag packing is done by higher-level SDK functions. However, it can be done manually using `flexPackFlags`.
For example:

```ts
import { flexPackFlags } from '@swaps-io/flex-sdk';

const value = flexPackFlags([
  true,      // Flag #0
  false,     // Flag #1
  true,      // Flag #2
  undefined, // Flag #3 (false)
  null,      // Flag #4 (false)
  true,      // Flag #5
], 7);       // Shift to higher bits (optional)

console.log(value); // Logs `5248n`: `0b1010010000000n`
```

#### Accumulator

...

#### Standalone

The standalone version is a contract that includes all of the current Flex [facets](#facet). The
[`FlexStandalone`](./contracts/standalone/FlexStandalone.sol) contract can be deployed on its own without the
[diamond](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) for hosting the facets.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Calls to the standalone version are more gas-efficient since they don't require storage reads of the implementation
> addresses like in the diamond proxy.
>
> This comes with a feature that it is not possible to modify the set of facets without redeploying the contract,
> i.e. standalone deploy is immutable.

## Examples

### EVM Token (Lock) to EVM Native

In this example, account `0x1010..1010` gives `123` of token `0xe0e0..e0e0` (`6` decimals) to account `0x2020..2020`
in the receive chain. In return that accounts gives `2.5` of native crypto (`18` decimals) back in the send chain.

Received token is stored in contract waiting for settlement - either confirm (requires key kept by `0x1010..1010`)
or refund (requires key kept by `0x2020..2020`). As a fallback to the key settlement (imagine one of the parties going
offline), similar proof settlement components are added to the order (TODO).
